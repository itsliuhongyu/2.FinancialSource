## Objective

This is my data analysis notebook for the Federal Election Commission database story. The original purpose of this analysis was to find if less journalists donated to political campaigns after 2020 when several news outlests including the Insider repoted on the issue. However, I soon realized that the database is too unreliable to conduct such a study, hence I have switched my focus of the reporting and interviews towards what makes the database unreliable, and whether its reliability have been improved in the past two years.

## Methodology

Using the FEC database, I have searched all the donation which the donors are labeled as "journalist" since 2016. I had to download the data for each election cycle separately due to the website restriction.
